# KMDesktop
 This is the alpha version .1 of Knowledge Manager Desktop.  
 This project is made up of two directories paths, SDSOKNServerServices contains the libraries for accessing allegrograph and the sdsokn server services in the SDSON-Services. 
 You will need to run the solution and add an allegrograph sever endpoint.
 The second directory path is the alpha version of the Knowledge Manager Desktop.   There are two directories, SDSOKNServerServices which holds the knowledge graph viewer and SignalR server.  The second directory is the actual Knowledge Manager desktop application.   You will need to modify the form1.cs with the allegrograph relevant information.
Future work includes extending it to support non-allegrograph sources, integrating the various tabs, adding spatial views, and consolidating the graph view.
